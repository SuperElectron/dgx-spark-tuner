# Journal — qwen36-35b-nvfp4-cells

Hypotheses before runs, lessons after them, a synthesis every ~5 rounds.
The last synthesis is the handoff every new session starts from.

## Premise — thin cells, not the crowded one

Board scan 2026-08-21 (live, single-node, verified against our own known
snapshot): 211 benchmarks spread across 93 test types x 5 concurrencies. The
headline cell (tg128 @ d16384 c1) is crowded and topped at 188.47 / 116.03
vLLM-NVFP4; we sit at 102.2 there and the -12% is currently unexplained.
Almost every other cell is nearly empty and topped by a weak entry:

| Cell | Entries | Top | Holder |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| tg32 @ d16384 c1 | 1 | 28.11 | Qwen3.6-27B-PrismaSCOUT-NVFP4 |
| tg32 @ d32768 c1 | 1 | 23.31 | same |
| tg32 @ d8192 c1 | 1 | — | same |
| tg128 @ d16384 c4 | 8 | 46.68 | Gemma-4-26B-A4B-NVFP4 |
| tg128 @ d65536 c1 | 2 | 16.48 | DeepSeek-V4-Flash-REAP MXFP4 |
| ctx_tg @ d65536 c1 | 1 | 20.70 | DeepSeek-V4-Flash-REAP FP8 |

Model is fixed for the campaign: nvidia/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4, the de-rayed
recipe carried over from qwen36-35b-quant (container vllm-node, kv fp8,
flashinfer, marlin MoE, MTP spec n=3, async scheduling). Only the probe
changes per round. `sparkrun benchmark perf` has no fixed official grid — the
cells measured are exactly the `-b` args passed — so the campaign picks its
own battlegrounds.

Carried-over discipline: medians not means (MTP draws are bimodal), verify any
win with a repeat, never vary probe args within a round.

## Round 1 hypothesis — tg32 sweep @ d8192 / d16384 / d32768, c1

The tg32 cells hold exactly one entry each, at 28.11 (d16384) and 23.31
(d32768) — a 27B NVFP4 config far below what this class can do. Our own model
decodes at median 102.2 in tg128 @ d16384 c1. tg32 is the same decode loop
measured over 32 tokens instead of 128, so fixed per-request overhead (prefill
handoff, first-token latency, MTP warmup) is amortized over 4x fewer tokens
and the number should land somewhat below the tg128 figure. Expect 85-100 at
d16384, less at d32768 as the KV read grows — still ~3x the incumbents.

Depth costs little here: only 10 of 40 layers carry a KV cache (the other 30
are Gated DeltaNet fixed-state), and it is stored FP8, so d8192 -> d32768
should bend the curve gently rather than cliff.

Mutation: none — this is the incumbent recipe, new probe. max_model_len is
raised 32768 -> 40960 because the deepest point needs depth 32768 + pp 2048 +
tg 32 to fit in one sequence.

Probe: -b tg=32 -b depth=8192,16384,32768 -b concurrency=1 -b runs=3
(pp=2048 rides along by default, so pp2048 @ dN and the ctx_ prefix-caching
phases are measured in the same run).
