# Results — qwen36-35b-nvfp4-cells

Model fixed: nvidia/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4 (de-rayed recipe). The campaign
varies the PROBE, not the config: each round measures a different board cell.
Targets and incumbents per cell: docs/arena-recipe.md.

Nothing is submitted to the arena — there is no login — so this file is the
standings. One row per measured CELL, appended after archiving into
`experiments/<benchId>/`. A single benchmark run measures several cells, so one
benchId spans several rows.

## Standings so far

Cells taken, best figure we have, against the board:

| Cell | Ours | Board top | Margin |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| tg32 @ d16384 c1 | 129.32 | 28.11 | **4.60x** |
| tg32 @ d32768 c1 | 115.56 | 23.31 | **4.96x** |
| tg32 @ d8192 c1 | 106.24 | sole entry, no number | uncontested |
| tg128 @ d16384 c4 | 52.85 | 46.68 | **1.13x**, verified |
| tg128 @ d65536 c1 | 108.15 | 16.48 | **6.56x** |
| ctx_tg128 @ d65536 c1 | 89.76 | 20.70 | **4.34x** |

Six cells taken. The two deep cells are the campaign's widest margins, and
`ctx_tg @ d65536 c1` is the FIRST prefix-caching cell we can actually claim —
it is the only `ctx_` cell whose board figure was ever scraped.

Cells measured but NOT claimed, because docs/arena-recipe.md never scraped their
board figures: every other `ctx_` prefix-caching cell and every `pp2048` cell
below. Scraping those six-plus figures is the cheapest standings gain available —
the numbers are already measured and sitting in the tables.

## Reading these tables

tg/pp columns are MEDIANS of the runs — means are not verdicts (MTP acceptance
is bimodal). σ is the run standard deviation, kept as the noise flag.
`ctx_` rows are the prefix-caching phase of the same run (a separate board cell).

**tg t/s is PER-REQUEST, not aggregate.** At c1 the two coincide; at c4 they do
not. The board publishes the same per-request metric, so these comparisons are
like-for-like, but a c4 row at 52.85 is ~211 tok/s of aggregate work.

## Prefill cells (pp2048)

pp2048 rides along in every round by default, so these were measured at no extra
cost. They are separate board cells and get their own rows. The cold rows fall
steeply with depth because they prefill the whole context; the `ctx_` rows reuse
the cached prefix and sit an order of magnitude higher.
